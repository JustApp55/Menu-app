This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/JustApp55/Menu-app).


## Usage of the website
A display of all items on Index Page
    ![Index Page of Items!](/public/images/index.png "Index Page")

To see only certain category (breakfast, lunch, drinks, & dessert) of food items, click one of the gray buttons below the "Menu Item" header on the Index page.

## Challenges During this Project
My original goal for the Menu app was to make this a fullstack application. Since I would like to teach myself other frontend applications, I decided to keep the frontend and backend separate, using the backend as an API for any frontend.

I decided to use React to know the framework well. It was part of the cirriculum at Per Scholas and a requirement for Project 3. This project was my opportunity to create a React application from start to finish.

I decided to build a backend application with Node, Mongoose, and Express, which you can view [here] (https://github.com/JustApp55/Menu-api)

### Deployment

This application is deployed on heroku: [https://jamenu-app.herokuapp.com/](https://jamenu-app.herokuapp.com/)
